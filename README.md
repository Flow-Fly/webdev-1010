### In case of issues pulling latest changes

In case you need to clear any local changes you have made,

## Script helpers

This repo comes with a script helper: `students.sh`. Run it and see. This is mainly intended for teaching team use.

### Generating groups

Run `./students.sh groups 3` to generate groups of three.

### Checking morning sunshines

Run `./students.sh sunshine` to find out who is doing morning sunshine next!

### Cloning lab repos

If you want a list of commands that can clone all the lab forks for every student, run `./students.sh lab <lab-repo-name>`. E.g. `./students.sh lab lab-css-instagram-clone`.

You can copy the printed commands and run them wherever you store cloned labs.
