# Getting set-up

- Let's first remember to ["Wax-on Wax-off"](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Bg21M2zwG9Q)
- In order to be able to retrieve all of the lessons done in class, **clone** the [class repository](https://github.com/Flow-Fly/webdev-1010)

    </summary>

  - Be on time
  - Don't copy / paste code you do not understand
  - Don't compare youself to others
  - There are no stupid questions
  - Try to read your lessons the day before class
  - Take notes (notepads, pen & paper, your choice), for questions as well
  - Don't be afraid to fail
  - Don't copy / paste code snippets, type them manually
  - Submit the Labs on the same day (except for Friday's Labs, can be submitted until Monday)
  - Debugging / asking for help during labs need to be done on the `#ask-for-support` channel (Slack)
  - Try to be the most autonomous:
    - Google
    - MDN
    - StackOverflow
    - Documentation
  - Google > MDN / Documentation / StackOverflow > #ask-for-support
  - Enjoy the roller-coaster
  - Wax-on Wax-off
